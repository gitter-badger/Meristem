## Here are some current thoughts around where to go next...

* Root all app startup via packages.  Currently leaning toward FAKE, Paket, self-resolving HTTP & TCP server
* Start with DocumentDB as the initial data store
* Pull Mapnik SDK as first SDK/tool, or, start a server first, then reference it.  A container would be ideal here.
* Fire off a web app that gulps data in a reactive manner and "automatically" ingests data using ACID, then turns around and provides Rx streams based on events
