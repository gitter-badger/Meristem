This <i>organic</i> geospatial undertaking will aim to collect, house, and distribute an opinionated geospatial toolbelt for the modern web.  The aim will be to constantly leverage new technologies that we believe serve the greater good in need of location-based intelligence.

## The What and the Why
The vast majority of geospatial toolsets, particularly those used on the web are either prohibitively expensive, unfriendly to traditional developers and platforms, or so blinded by marketing goggles that developers can't even contrast the lot against one another; they just stick with the latest hotness or the private gorilla in the room.  The aim behind Meristem is to consolidate the "best of breed" tools and solutions to better the overall location analytics industry.

## The How
Simply put, if you're caught up in the world of tunnel vision, or worse yet, unwarranted <i>hatred</i> toward an ecosystem, then there may not be much here for you.  The aim with this project is to encourage the geospatial developer world to finally get up to speed with the rest of info tech in an objective and open manner.
